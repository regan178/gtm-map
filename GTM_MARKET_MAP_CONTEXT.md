# GTM Market Map — First Principles & Objectives

## Core Objective

Build a forward-looking, defensible view of the **GTM technology landscape under AI disruption** for growth-stage and AI-native companies.
This isn't a static "vendor list" — it's a **framework** showing *where GTM is going*, not where it's been.

The market map serves as a tool to:

* Inform portfolio companies' GTM design and tooling decisions.
* Reflect a16z Growth's AI-first worldview.
* Position RevOps as an **engineering discipline** at the center of this transformation.

## First Principles

### 1. AI-First is Non-Optional

Every GTM workflow — sales, marketing, RevOps, success — is **AI-augmentable by default**.
AI agents, copilots, and orchestration layers are the new baseline for modern revenue engines.

### 2. Buy → Build Spectrum

Replace the legacy "point solution landscape" with a **continuum** of how GTM capabilities are delivered:

| Layer                        | Description                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Established SaaS Leaders** | Buy/configure. Mature tools (Salesforce, Clari, Gong, etc).                               |
| **AI-Native Disruptors**     | Emerging next-gen SaaS (Clay, Artisan, Granola, etc).                                     |
| **Low-Code Orchestrators**   | Compose workflows (n8n, Pipedream, Retool Workflows, Superblocks).                        |
| **Agentic SDK Builders**     | Code and orchestrate agents (LangChain, LangGraph, AgentKit, Claude Skills, MCP servers). |

This models how modern GTM engineers actually work: blending build, compose, and buy.

### 3. RevOps as Engineering Discipline

RevOps is evolving into **GTM Engineering** — lean technical generalists building internal tools and agentic workflows, not just configuring SaaS.

### 4. Evidence-Based Inclusion

Only include "Emerging Innovators" that show **velocity** — recent funding, headcount growth, or product-ship cadence.
Companies with flat or negative growth (e.g. Workato) fail this bar.

### 5. Cross-Cutting Layers

Two horizontal stacks apply across all GTM categories:

* **Low-Code Orchestration:** n8n, Zapier, Pipedream, Retool, Superblocks, Relevance AI, Windmill, Kestra.
* **Agentic Coding / SDKs:** Cursor, Replit, OpenAI AgentKit + Responses API, Anthropic Claude Code + Skills, xAI Grok, LangChain, LangGraph, MCP servers.

These represent the **shared infrastructure** used by RevOps engineers and GTM developers to build automation and agents.

### 6. Full Customer Lifecycle Coverage

The updated top-level categories span the full GTM journey — ICP, Marketing, Data, Outbound, Enablement, Deal Execution, Forecasting, Conversational Intelligence, Customer Success, and Planning & Ops.
This mirrors how growth-stage companies view revenue as an end-to-end system.

---

## Strategic Outcomes

* Create a **Vercel-hosted market map** that visualizes AI disruption across GTM.
* Keep it **exclusive and defensible** — every inclusion backed by evidence.
* Position a16z Growth as the **thought leader** in AI-native GTM and RevOps transformation.
* Provide portfolio founders and operators with a shared vocabulary and model for how AI is reshaping GTM design.

## In Short

This initiative defines a **living, AI-first GTM framework** that captures how high-growth companies are rebuilding their revenue operations stack — shifting from buying SaaS to **building custom, agentic workflows**.
